the sense of this proposition is, consider its negation. At most it might be \n\
taken to mean \"I know I have the organs of a human\". (E. g. a brain which, \n\
after all, no one has ever yet seen.) But what about such a proposition as \n\
\"I know I have a brain\"? Can I doubt it? Grounds for doubt are lacking! \n\
